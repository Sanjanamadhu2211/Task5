# Task5
In this task, I implemented decision tree and random forest models on the Heart Disease dataset. I trained and visualized a decision tree, controlled depth to reduce overfitting, and trained a random forest to compare accuracy. Feature importances were analyzed, and model performance was validated using cross-validation.

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn ->  for visualizations
- Scikit-learn -> for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and evaluation metrics
